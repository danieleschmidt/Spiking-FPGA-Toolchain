# SDLC Analysis for Spiking-FPGA-Toolchain

## Classification
- **Type**: Experimental/Research Project (documentation phase)
- **Deployment**: Source distribution only (no implementation yet)
- **Maturity**: Prototype/PoC (documentation exists, implementation pending)
- **Language**: None yet (Python + HDL planned for implementation)

## Purpose Statement
A comprehensive open-source toolchain for compiling spiking neural networks to commodity FPGA hardware, aimed at democratizing neuromorphic computing research by providing an affordable alternative to specialized chips like Intel Loihi.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- **Excellent Documentation Foundation**: Comprehensive README, architecture docs, project charter, and roadmap
- **Clear Technical Vision**: Well-defined multi-layer architecture with specific performance targets
- **Structured Planning**: Detailed ADRs, roadmap with specific milestones, and stakeholder analysis
- **Research-Grade Planning**: Professional project charter with risk assessment and resource requirements
- **Multi-Platform Strategy**: Thoughtful FPGA platform selection (Xilinx + Intel support)

### Gaps
- **No Implementation**: Zero source code - this is purely a documentation/planning repository
- **Missing Development Infrastructure**: No package.json, setup.py, or build configuration
- **No Testing Framework**: No test structure or CI/CD pipelines
- **Missing Community Files**: No CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, or issue templates
- **Incomplete Project Structure**: Referenced src/ directories don't exist

### Recommendations

Given this is a **documentation-only research prototype**, the appropriate SDLC improvements are:

#### For Academic/Research Documentation Projects

1. **Project Foundation Setup**
   - Create basic Python package structure (setup.py/pyproject.toml)
   - Add placeholder source directories matching documentation architecture
   - Establish development environment setup (requirements.txt, .env.example)

2. **Research Collaboration Infrastructure**
   - CONTRIBUTING.md with research collaboration guidelines
   - Issue templates for research discussions, feature requests, and bug reports
   - Citation guidelines and academic acknowledgment processes
   - Research ethics and data sharing policies

3. **Academic Quality Assurance**
   - Pre-commit hooks for documentation formatting
   - Automated documentation link checking
   - Reference validation and citation formatting
   - Version control for research artifacts

4. **Community Building for Research**
   - GitHub Discussions for technical research discussions
   - Documentation for setting up development environment
   - Guidelines for academic contributors and industry collaborators
   - Integration with academic publishing workflows

#### Priority Order
- **P0**: Basic project structure that matches the documented architecture
- **P1**: Collaboration infrastructure for academic research community  
- **P2**: Quality assurance for documentation and research artifacts
- **P3**: Community building tools for research adoption

#### What NOT to Add
- Complex CI/CD pipelines (no code to test yet)
- Performance monitoring (no implementation to monitor)
- Security scanning (no code to scan)
- Docker containers (nothing to containerize)
- Advanced automation (premature for current stage)

This project is in the **planning/documentation phase** and should focus on research collaboration infrastructure rather than production software tooling.
