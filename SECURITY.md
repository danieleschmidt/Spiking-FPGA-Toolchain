| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Considerations

### FPGA Hardware Security

Since this toolchain generates HDL for FPGA deployment, we take hardware security seriously:

- **Generated HDL**: All generated Verilog/VHDL code should be reviewed for potential security vulnerabilities
- **Bitstream Integrity**: Users should verify bitstream integrity before deployment
- **Side-Channel Resistance**: Consider power analysis and timing attack resistance in neuromorphic designs
- **Memory Protection**: Ensure proper isolation between network partitions on shared FPGA resources

### Software Security

- **Input Validation**: All network definitions and configuration files are validated
- **Secure Toolchain Integration**: Vivado and Quartus integrations use secure subprocess execution
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of Python dependencies
- **Code Injection Prevention**: Sanitization of all user-provided HDL templates

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@spiking-fpga-toolchain.org
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in our repository
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available upon request

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, hardware damage potential
- **High**: Privilege escalation, significant data exposure
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, denial of service
- **Low**: Minor information leaks, configuration issues
