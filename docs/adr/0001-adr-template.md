# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a way to capture important architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle. This template provides a consistent format for documenting decisions.

## Decision
We will use ADRs to document significant architectural decisions following this template format:

### Required Sections:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that motivates this decision
- **Decision**: The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change

### Optional Sections:
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details about implementation
- **Related Decisions**: Links to other ADRs that influenced this decision

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Consistent documentation format across the project
- Historical record of architectural decisions and their rationale
- Better onboarding for new team members
- Explicit consideration of trade-offs

### Negative:
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Risk of documentation becoming outdated

## Implementation Notes
- Place new ADRs in the `docs/adr/` directory
- Use sequential numbering: `0001-decision-title.md`
- Keep ADRs immutable after acceptance (create new ADR to supersede if needed)
- Reference related ADRs using relative links
